# Task 7: Implementing Navigation and Routing in a ecommerce Mobile App
You have been tasked with building a simple ecommerce mobile app using Flutter. The app should allow users to create, view, update and delete products. As part of this project, you are required to implement navigation and routing features to ensure a seamless user experience.
## 1. Screen Navigation: (3 points)
    The app should have the following screens:
      - A home screen that displays a list of all the products.
      - A screen to add/edit a new product.
      - A screen to view an existing product when selected from the list.
      - Implement navigation between these screens using Flutter's built-in navigation methods.
## 2. Named Routes: (1 point)
- Define named routes for each screen in the app. Utilize named routes to navigate between screens rather than using anonymous routes.
## 3. Passing Data Between Screens: (3 points)
- When adding or editing a product, allow the user to input the product's title and description.
- Pass the product data from the home screen to the add/edit product screens and back to the home screen when the product is created or updated.
## 4. Navigation Animations: (2 points)
 - Implement smooth navigation animations and transitions between screens to enhance the user experience.
## 5. Handling Navigation Events: (1 point)
- When the user presses the back button from the add/edit product screen, ensure the app navigates back to the home screen. Handle any other necessary navigation events appropriately.
